### Hello individuals 
*I am here to.... not to bring world peace for sure*
I am an italian :it: highschool student, the only reason I am learning to code :computer: is because of a certain [@Gabriele-Cutrona](https://github.com/Gabriele-Cutrona) and I do not do it for fame or money ðŸ’¸ **LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE** I know...

I thought that it would be better suited for me Javascript, but i hate it and I am loving c++ soo... fuck Javascript (for now...).

I also like to do some pixelart ðŸŽ¨ in my free time, but I think both of them will never become my work, because I will probably work in the military ðŸª–, I am already working on it too.

you don't need to know my background so stop looking at this README... sho sho.
